BrewsCruise will be a full-stack app. Users will be able to see a map of hot springs across Colorado, click on an instance and see nearby breweries.. for obvious important reasons.

In addition, users can add instances to the map that aren't already listed.

This app will be built on Angular.

This app will use a database. Probably Firebase.

This app currently uses in memory web api and in memory data service to mock api and database functionality.

Future iterations will integrate Firebase for the database and consume a hot springs api that I'm in the process of building with plans to host in the long run.
