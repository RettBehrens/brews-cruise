BrewsCruise will be a full-stack app. Users will be able to see a map of hot springs across Colorado, click on an instance and see nearby breweries.. for obvious important reasons.

In addition, users can add instances to the map that aren't already listed.

This app will be built on Angular.. or maybe React..

This app will use a database.. to be determined based on data relationships as they emerge.
